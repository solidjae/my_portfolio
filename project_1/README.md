# Project #1: Your Portfolio Site

## Attendance

There are no full day classes during project weeks, but we do expect you to be working on your project daily and be available during the usual class times (9AM - 5PM Eastern) for any meetings and check-ins with instructors as needed.

There are **daily attendance checks on weekdays at 9:00AM EST and 2:00PM EST**. A thread will be posted in the classroom channel at those times and you must respond to it within 2 hours or you will be marked absent. _Again, failure to make an attendance check will result in an absence_.

**Important Dates to Remember:**

- **Tuesday Nov 8th**: Project presentation day! You're required to be in the class zoom starting at 9:00 AM Eastern
  - NOTE: You should have your project finished before 9:00 AM so that you can give your fellow classmates full attention during their presentation
- **Outcomes**: The day and time for the outcomes meeting is normal as usual.

## Project Details

You will be building a portfolio site for yourself.

### &#x1F534; Mandatory To Pass:

#### MVP - Minimum Viable Product

#### Your application must meet these requirements:

1. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery.
1. Hosted on Netlify or Github Pages.
1. Commits to Github every day.
1. A `README.md` file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, a link to your live site, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.

#### The app must:

1. Have the following pages:
	- home (greeting page)
	- bio (your background)
	- resume (past work experience)
	- projects (a place to hold interesting projects that you build)
	- links (links to your github, linkedin, and other sites you find interesting)
		- optionally, instead of making this a separate page, you can make these links appear as part of a navigation section that appears on all pages
1. Use JS/JQuery to create at least three points of interaction for the user (e.g. the user clicks on something and something happens).  Write these from scratch.  Each point should be a different kind of interaction (i.e. don't just create 3 modals).  Don't use 3rd party frameworks/libraries like jQuery UI, bootstrap, etc.  Also, don't use `alert()` or `prompt()`.  Any messaging to, or input from, the user should appear in the DOM.
1. Implement responsive design (i.e. it should be fully functional on desktop, tablet, mobile, etc.).

### &#x1F535; Stretch Goals (Not Mandatory):

- Create a complex user interface module (e.g. a carousel, modal, sticky nav, etc)
- Create an additional browser-based game (e.g. a quiz, choose your own adventure, battle game, etc)
- Research AJAX (covered later in this course) and create an app that displays interesting data from an external source (ask your instructor for a list of good sources)

## Make A New Repo

:heavy_exclamation_mark: Make your new repo on [GitHub](https://github.com/), **not** GitHub Enterprise!
  - This is so that anyone can see your repo, not just people signed up to GA's Enterprise instance of Github
  - We recommend that you name your repo appropriately (for example `portfolio`, and _**not**_ something like `unit-one-project`).

:heavy_exclamation_mark: **Do not** begin your project within the class repo.

:heavy_exclamation_mark: **Do not** clone your project into the class repo.

1. After your project has been approved, [make a new github repo for your project](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/).

## Deploying your Project

For anyone to be able to see and use your project, you must deploy it online somewhere. For this project, you will be deploying it onto either Netlify or GitHub Pages


#### Try to use Netlify first...
  - Directions for deploying to Netlify can be found in this [markdown](./neflify.md)


#### If for some reason, Netlify is not working for you, deploy on GH Pages...
  - For directions on using GH Pages, follow the instructions outlined by Github themselves on [github.io](https://pages.github.com/)

  - Follow the instructions under: Project Site > Start from Scratch

<details><summary>Extra: want your own domain name?</summary>

You can also host your github pages with your own domain name. [Here is a walkthrough from namecheap, one web hosting service](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9645/2208/how-do-i-link-my-domain-to-github-pages)

</details>

## Technical Demonstration

All projects will be presented to the class. Your presentation should:

- Be approximately 5 minutes in length. This is a large class, so keeping your presentation sweet and succinct is key -- consider practicing your presentation beforehand.
- Show off all features of the app itself.
- Explain the technical details.
- Explain the technical challenges.
- Explain which improvements you might make in the future.

You will be sharing your app and your code. Be prepared to answer questions from the instructors and other students.

## Meetings with instructors

_An instructor will contact you to setup a meeting time to approve your project._

**Tuesday November 1st (Today!) by EOD - Mandatory**<br>

You will meet with an instructor for a few minutes to get your app idea approved.

_How to prepare for your project approval_

- Draw wireframes
  - at least one wireframe of how your site will look
  - (draw more for multiple views)
- Make a schedule for yourself of what you want to accomplish
  - First day most details
  - Second day less details broader strokes of what you want to accomplish
  - Further: try to pick 'milestones' (check with the project markdown that you are building what you need for MVP) and determine the order of importance, be sure to have a separate list for stretch goals
  - This takes practice so be ready to adjust your schedule

    - **Note: You will have to make changes and adjust/adapt as you build**

## How to Submit Your Project

Your project is due on Tuesday, Nov 8th at 9:00 am EST. You will present your project and show your code to classmates and instructors.

:heavy_check_mark: Add your project to [this google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jvgNzS1o7fcVMvS7xgqL_lC-lO2rsmAe8tZbHOCn9-k/edit?usp=sharing). Note that this will be the order you present your projects!

## Where to go for help during project week
**"A ship is safe in harbor, but that’s not what ships are built for."**

1. Seek out help online.
1. Seek out help with your classmates. Make sure you post in the sos channel so the instructors can keep track of who is asking for help!
1. Seek out help with our class TA.
1. After all other avenues have been exhausted, seek help from your assigned instructor. Please refer to [How to Ask a Question](https://git.generalassemb.ly/Software-Engineering-Immersive-Remote/SEIR-Eevee/wiki/How-To-Ask-A-Question) before you reach out.

**TA Hours** (all normal times EST)

## Suggested Ways to Get Started

- **Wireframe** Make a drawing of what your app will look like in all of its stages (what does it look like as soon as you log on to the site?  about page?)

- **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.

- **Consult documentation resources** (MDN, jQuery, etc.) at home to better understand what you’ll be getting into.

### Think about...

- **Creativity**  
  Did you add a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user?

- **Code Quality**  
  Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, indentation, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

- **Problem Solving**  
  Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?
